Why root access is not permitted
	By disabling root, we significantly shrink the attack surface from brute force attackers. Root is a known username, and therefore gets repeatedly attacked. Once compromised, the attacker has full control.
	It is best practice to login with unprivileged accounts, then sudo for admin tasks. This limits the blast radius of potential credential leaks.
	You can check root login permit by `sudo sshd -T | grep permitrootlogin`. This gets effective configuration parsed from `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` without launching or testing server instance. Unlike -t which only checks syntax, -T reveals runtime values safely, with no restart needed.
	The default listening port for ssh is 22. You can try connecting via `ssh username@hostname -p [portnumber]`. You can add a port to listen to by editing /etc/ssh/sshd_config with sudo nano or any other editor of your choice.
